OptimisingWindTurbines

OptimisingWindTurbines is a desktop application made in Windows Forms with C# to assist the user in the planning and optimisation of wind turbine fields. It does this by utilising the Katic-Jensen wake model to calculate the wind wake effect, power output and cost of a wind turbine field suggested by the user, and helping them to find the most efficient pattern.
