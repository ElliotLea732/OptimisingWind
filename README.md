OptimisingWindTurbines

OptimisingWindTurbines is a desktop application made in Windows Forms with C# to assist the user in the planning and optimisation of wind turbine fields. It does this by utilising the Katic-Jensen wake model to calculate the wind wake effect, before calculating the power output and cost of a wind turbine field suggested by the user, in order to help them to find the most efficient pattern.

(Turbine image included in repository may need to be manually moved to the bin/debug file.)
